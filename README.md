experiments in Rust on Advent of Code 2023 puzzles


## Usage/Examples

clone this repo and `cd` into it and use `cargo run --bin part-1` to run it

create a crate for each day using cargo

```bash
cargo new day-01
```

move into the day package and duplicate main.rs into `part1.rs` and `part2.rs` files under a new `src/bin` folder

then you can run each part separately using `cargo`

```bash
cd day-01

cargo run --bin part-1

cargo run --bin part-2
```

reuse the same approach for each calendar day
